    /// Many TA functions, such as the Exponential Moving Average (EMA), utilize algorithms that retain memory of previous data points.

    /// By default, there is no unstable period set for any TA function. It is up to the consumer to determine the appropriate number of periods to strip off.
    /// The general guideline is to strip off as many periods as necessary to achieve consistent results.
