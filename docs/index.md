## Overview

``TALib.NETCore`` is an independent .NET adaptation of the renowned Technical Analysis Library ([TA-Lib](https://ta-lib.org/)) originally developed by Mario Fortier -
an open-source ANSI C library, which offers a comprehensive suite of functions for technical analysis of financial time series data.

## Motivation

The original TA-Lib library was written in C, released in 2001 and has been widely used in the financial industry for many years.
The goal of this project is to provide a modern, fully managed .NET library that is compatible with the latest versions of .NET
leveraging the best performance optimization techniques.

## Installation

A compiled binary of the library is provided by the `TALib.NETCore` NuGet package.
To install it, run the following command in the Package Manager Console:

```shell
    Install-Package TALib.NETCore
```

or in .NET Core CLI:

```shell
    dotnet add package TALib.NETCore
```
